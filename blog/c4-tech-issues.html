  <h1>Security and Technology Today</h1>
  <h2>An often overlooked issue</h2>

      We live in a world that continually produces more and more technology startups. Many of these companies end up focusing most of their tech resources on flashy consumer facing features that will help with their PR or Sales. What could this leave in the dark? One of the most important components of technology - security.
    </p>
    <p>
      We continually hear about security breaches in companies today. Credit card information leaked, emails and password databases left vulnerable, and so many other problems. With consumers today becoming more and more comfortable sharing their information with web services and technology companies, it is incredibly important that the technology industry focuses on protecting that data. My fear with startups is that they so often focus on shipping code quickly, looking for the shortest distance between two points, that they may overlook or cut a corner on a security vulnerability. Furthermore, with lean startup teams, it can be rare for a startup to have a full time person focused on security. I think that having a person focused full time on security is essential. Otherwise companies will end up taking on a lot of technical debt in the security of their data that will have to be either serviced in the future, or potentially breached.
    </p>
    <p>
      One approach I find very interesting and resourceful is when companies encourage 'Hackers' to attempt a breach of their technology, with an often times hefty bounty offered for a breach. This is an interesting approach because it encourages 'crowdsourcing' of knowledge to audit any security vulnerabilities of a company. This is a win win for companies, because they allow a large number of people to pick away at their technology looking for weak points, while also offering a reward for a successful exposed vulnerability.
    </p>
    <p>
      Maybe there's room for a consulting startup that performs consistent security audits on other startups. Regardless, companies should put security at the highest priority. Putting secuirty on the backburner in order to be able to ship more flashy or cool consumer facing features is an incredible disservice to consumers. The effort required to build secure walls around technology is much less painful than the headache caused by a breach.
