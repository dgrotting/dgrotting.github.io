  <h1>Ruby Classes and Modules</h1>
  <h2>Sharing is Caring</h2>

      Classes and modules allow you to share certain attributes and behaviors between objects. In this blog post I want to show you a case in which you would use both modules and classes. I watched a good youtube video that explained how classes and modules work, so I am going to share a slight variation of their example. Lets think about classes for a moment in the context of Animals. Lets create a class called Animal that has the attributes of :age and :name, like all animals have. Now, lets create two more classes, Dog and Cat, which both inherit from Animal. These two new classes can have unique attributes to cats and dogs. Now lets go one step further, and have the classes Puppy and Kitten, which inherit from Dog and Cat, respectively. Let's take a look at what these classes would look like in code.
    </p>

     Check out the code above. You would expect fido the puppy and spot the dog to both inherit behaviors from the dog class when called to 'sit.' Fido responds differently, however, because he is a puppy. In the puppy class, we included the module 'UntrainedAnimal' which can contain specific traits of untrained animals like puppies and kittens. We can include this module for all classes of untrained animals that would be relevant. Now look at the code again and you will see in the UntrainedAnimal module that we define the sit method as 'puts "I just peed on the floor"'. This is why any puppy or kitten that you invoke the sit method on will not sit, but pee instead.
    </p>
    <p>
      Classes make sense for a hierarchical structure of behavioral inheritance. Modules, on the other hand, can give various relevant classes access to cerating behaviors even if the behaviors are not exactly relevant to the tree structure. This allows you to simply include a module in a class instead of rewriting all the methods in each class. Pretty cool, right?
