  <h1>Meet Version Control, Git and GitHub - Your New Best Friends</h1>
  <h2>You can't have a beer with them, but they've got your back</h2>
  <h4>The Twentieth of March in the fine year of 2015</h4>

      Version control could very well be your best friend. He keeps tabs on you often, making sure to back you up when you fall down. He encourages you to try new things, and lets you know that there is always a fallback if the new 'thing' doesn't work out. But honestly, version control with git is a truly incredible system. Version control allows you to continually work on a project and create snapshots in time as you add on new additions to your project. Just like a checkpoint in a game, you know you can always fall back to that checkpoint if you fail. Version control with git allows you to create checkpoints for your code however often you would like. How cool is that? Accidentally delete a block of code? Git can revert to the most recent checkpoint with the code. Accidentally introduce a bug? Git can help you go back to a time when the bug was nonexistant.

        In order for version control and git to become your best friend, you must be a good friend to it. What does this mean? You must 'ping' git often to save a historical snapshot of new work you have created!How do you do this? With a 'git commit'! As you continue to make additions and updates to your code, you must package those changes into a git commit. You first start off a commit by modifying your code. When you are seemingly happy with the code - you can stage the changes. After staging the changes, you can 'commit' the changes. The key here is that you must put a message with each commit describing what code you have modified. If the commit looks good to you, you can create a pull request and ask a team member to review your code then merge it to the master branch. Or you can merge it yourself! It's just that simple. Just remember to commit often!

        Now what about if you are working on a project with others? GitHub has your back! GitHub is a remote repository where you can store projects. You can have team members all access the same code base, and make modifications to it on their local machine. The huge benefit of this is that each team member can be working on the project remotely at the same time - then merge in his or her code changes to the master code repo. This avoids team members working on a number of different versions. As you make your unique changes and merge them to the master branch, your team members are able to pull in those changes without impacting any changes they might be working on. GitHub allows you to work remotely as a team on the same project without stepping on eachothers' toes.

        <b> Woohoo! </b>
