  <h1>Thinking about thinking</h1>

      Concrete Random...What does that mean? Well... apparently that's my thinking style according the Anthony Gregorc learning style test. Concrete random thinkers are known to be experimenters. I have found myself quick to experiment on the weekly challenges, sometimes before I have clarity on the task. I sometimes get so excited to dive in and do trial and error on a challenge, that I might miss an important instruction or step. There are ways that I can use this learning style to my advantage. I am energized by making progress through trial and error, and love accomplishing something that I work at for awhile. In some of the challenges, I can find myself frustrated if I can't find the solution, and feel stumped. I am learning to take a more 'zen' approach to the challenges rather than trying to rush through it to an answer. By being more organized in my thoughts and approach, I can utilize what I've learned then begin to strategicly experiment with solutions. A few techniques that DBC encourages have been helpful to me. First, pseudocoding has been very helpful. By walking through in plain english what it is that I am trying to solve for, I can translate piece by piece the steps into code. Whenever I am appriaching a challenge, I need to be thoughtful on taking a few minutes to pseudocode. This goes the same with my learning. When I get through a chapter or some materials, I need to do a recap and try to describe what I learned instead of rushing to the next materials. Becoming more organized, strategic, and thoughtful in all of my work will be necessary for success.

      I am really liking the idea of moving towards a growth mindset. It has also been a challenge to break my more natural inclination to a fixed mindset. A couple things that have been a challenge for me: 1. Breaking competitive tendencies. When I feel like the rest of my cohort is way ahead of me on the materials, I get frustrated and feel stressed as if I am failing to keep up. I want to change this into a beneficial view knowing that I am surrounded by incredible peers to learn more from. 2. When I cannot solve a challenge or cannot wrap my head around a certain concept, I feel my brain giving up and sensing failure. Instead of becoming frustrated, I need to tap into my awareness and ask myself important questions - Why am I having a hard time with this material? Am I being to narrow on my approach? It is easy to get wrapped up in frustration and get locked in a stagnant mindset, but I am learning to be more flexible and aware. At the ned of the day, I am learning more and more each day. I am expanding my understanding of technology, which is incredible. I need to maintain perspective of my progress through the program as a whole and not get wrapped up in the struggles along the way. I am excited to learn more about myself as I move towards a growth mindset, especially since I have not focused on my mindset much before. As I become more aware of my learning style and mindset, I look forward to becoming more in tune with others. To be an effective member of any team, awareness of one's self and empathy towards others is essential. I am most excited to be on site with the rest of my cohort, as I feel that I will be able to truly gain a better sense of my teammates in DBC. Onward!
