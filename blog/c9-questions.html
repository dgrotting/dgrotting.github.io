  <h1>Questions</h1>
  <h2>For when you want the best answer</h2>

      “Judge a man by his questions rather than by his answers.” ― Voltaire
      <br><br>
      A good question deserves a good answer, and a bad question deserves a bad answer. What entails a good question? Questions need to be pointed and detailed to have a clear ask. Otherwise, you might not get the answer you want or intended to ask for. Last year, I was getting a ton of traffic from Google Adwords to my website, yet I did not have any google ads running. It was one of the most frustrating things to troubleshoot, because I felt I exhausted every idea. I finally posted on the Google forums asking if other people had experienced this issue. I wrote something along the lines of "I am getting lots of traffic from adwords, but I have no ads running...What could this be?" Now this question is extremely vague. How could I have made it better? Perhaps giving some background to if i had ever run ads, or if there was an affiliate program I was running. I could have attached a screenshot of the traffic sources, and maybe the times that I was seeing the traffic. Because this was a bad question, I got bad answers. Some of my answers were even questions themselves. This was a huge red flag that I clearly did not explain my issue well at all.

      When you ask a quesiton you must think about what information to include. You have more knowledge as the question asker in terms of what you are seeking to learn. Think about it as bumpers in a bowling game. If you ask a question and give enough information along with the question, the answer is more likely to be a strike and not get derailed as a gutter ball. I look forward to practicing asking better questions through DBC, as good questions are essential when working with others.
