      Family, Friendship, Independence, Adventure, Achievement, and Creativity. These are all values I care about and find myself most happy when they are fulfilled. In this blog post I would like to write about my favorite place in the world, and how it encapsulates these values. My favorite place in the entire world is my little surf shack in northern Baja, Mexico. It is about 1.5 hours from my home in San Diego. This little surf shack was handed down to a buddy and me about 6 years ago. It was in bad shape when it was handed down to us - no running water, no electricity, extremely dirty and falling apart. Over the past few years, I have been able to flex my adventure and creativity through working on the house. We have built a new deck on the balcony, created a self sustaining solar electricity system, built a pila system to have running water, repainted and cleaned out much of the house, and so much more. This house is a total playground for my interests. I feel a great sense of achievement when I accomplish a project - especially if creatively and frugally. I love adventuring throughout Mexico around the house and farther because it is still much of a frontier. Many people feel unsafe in Mexico, so exploring the area has a feeling of excitement and unknown. Now these projects and working on the house are very fulfilling in using my creativity, but my favorite part about the surf cabin is the family and friends it draws. I am writing this having just returned from the house with my mom, dad, brother, and cousin. The cabin is a place all about getting unplugged, enjoying the ocean, and spending time with friends and family. Weekends are full of games, being outdoor, and spending time with one another. I cannot think of a place in my life where more memories have been made. For all these reasons, the cabin is my favorite place on earth. It jives so well with all of my interests in building and creativity, but more than anything a place to spend quality time with friends and family.

      I ultimately would like to find a place in my career where work draws some of this feeling. I want to be creative in work and feel empowered. I want to feel adventurous, possibly by working in a new and exciting field. And more than anything I want to enjoy work with friends. Whether it is starting a business with friends and family, or simply becoming very close with my colleagues. Paying atention to your values is very important. By paying attention to what you care about most, you can optimize your life to the fullest and seek out opportunities that align with your values. I look forward to working through DBC with a keen sense of what I am enjoying from a work value perspective. I know that I will become close with my cohort, and I look forward to the long lasting relationships we will build.
