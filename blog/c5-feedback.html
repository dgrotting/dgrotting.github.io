  <h1>Pairing and Feedback</h1>
  <h2>Fundamentals of DBC</h2>

    <h4>Pairing</h4>
    <p>
      I have thoroughly enjoyed pairing on the various challenges of DBC. I find that there are a number of benefits to pairing in challenges. First of all, pairing makes challenges much more fun. I find myself sometimes getting frustrated when I work on a challenge alone when I can't find a solution. This is often a result of rushing through the challenge and not paying attention to each detail. When I pair with someone on a challenge, I am much more methodical and process oriented. I go through each of the steps of the challenge much more carefully, and speak out my thoughts along the way. This allows me to catch any silly mistakes I might have otherwise made while working on a challenge alone. There is also a great benefit to having two perspectives on a challenge. There are so many ways to accomplish a solution to a challenge, and everyone approaches the challenge differently. I broaden my coding perspective when working with others by listening to their approach and the way they think through challenges. I also find that I pair better with some people than others. I find that I most often enjoy pairing with people who are very vocal. When I pair with someone who is quiet, it is hard to gain much of their perspective or thinking. Overall, pairing makes coding much more fun and I end up learning more through a challenge than I would've alone.

      Learning to give and receive feedback through DBC has been a good learning experience. Most of my feedback has been positive, but there have been some repeated notes on things I can work on. One piece of feedback that I have seen a few times is that I sometimes get too excited about trying something and quickly implement the code and run it without telling my pair. If it works out, I will explain what I did. I need to do the opposite, however. I need to explain my logic or approach before I implement it so that my pair can decide if they think it is a reasonable solution. It is great to receive feedback like this because I would've otherwise continued these habits. I am also learning to give better feedback. Making sure that my feedback is Actionable, Specific, and Kind has been challenging. Sometimes if I have feedback for someone - I cannot think of a kind way to put it so I might omit it from the feedback. I need to learn how to package feedback so that it is specific and actionable. I find that my feedback is often high level "great job! fun pairing with you" etc. even if there is something that bothered me about the pairing session. I will push myself to write better feedback in upcoming challenges, because I know how much I have gained from other people's feedback for me. This ability to give and receive feedback will ultimately make me a better colleague, leader, and ultimately friend and person.
