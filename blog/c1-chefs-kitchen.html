  <h1>A New Type of Learning at Dev Bootcamp</h1>
  <h2>Ready to roll up my sleeves and dive in</h2>
  <h4>March 20th, 2015</h4>

      Wow. I am very excited for Dev Bootcamp. The learning experience and environment seem unlike anything I have ever been a part of. Dev Bootcamp places an emphasis on a few things that I truly appreciate. I am looking forward to a learning approach that focuses on emotional intelligence and growth as opposed to a fixed mindset or IQ. I am so used to education systems that place the emphasis on grade points or scores, and class rankings. Dev Bootcamp seems to create a collaborative environment that fosters sharing of knowledge, and awareness of self and others through the learning process. Over the past few months, I have been attending yoga classes most days, and focusing on awareness of breath and body. I am starting to see the benefits of being aware of both self and others, and how you can approach situations differently. Dev Bootcamp seems to encourage students to be keenly aware of their thoughts and feelings, as well as being empathetic of others throughout the learning process. I think this is hugely contributive to success - especially at such a rigorous and intensive program. I am not afraid to fail at tasks in Dev Bootcamp - because I know that it will encourage me to understand more about how something works.

      I want to express humility and not be scared to ask questions, because that is the only way to grow. The ability to be aware of how you learn, create productive environments for yourself, and be an effective team member is incredibly valuable. Dev Bootcamp is not a 'stamp of approval' that you aim for upon completion, but rather an experience that will allow you to develop a new skillset through a process of personal growth. Already in week one, I think of my cohort as my team, as opposed to my class. I know that my experience at Dev Bootcamp will make me a better team member, leader, and person, through their approach to learning. Though I know it will be challenging, I know it will be one of the most rewarding experiences I have been a part of thus far in my life. Onward!
