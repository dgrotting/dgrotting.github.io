  <h1>Ruby Classes</h1>
  <h2>The Classiest of Objects</h2>
  <h4>April 18th 2015</h4>

    <p>
      Ruby classes are a beautiful thing. I like the analogy of a ruby class as a blueprint. Once you have a blueprint for something - you can simply repeat the blueprint in different cases and end up with the same or a similar result. Ruby classes hold specific methods that can be applied to objects of that class. I am going to walk you through an example of a ruby class through the context of a surfboard rental company. Lets assume that a surfboard rental company has 3 types of surfboards, all costing a different daily amount. The rental company also has a pricing policy that says if you rent the board for more than 2 days, you get 20% off your entire rental. We will first define a class called SurfboardRentals, then define the methods that will show the pricing for renting each board for a different number of days. Here is the pricing breakdown: <b>Foam Board - $15/day Shortboard - $20/day  Longboard - $25/day *All Rentals over 2 days are 20% off*.</b>
    </p>
      <script src="https://gist.github.com/dgrotting/7f03ecb72c263c6d1d98.js"></script>
    <p>
      As you can see, we take the arguments of two variables - a surfboard type and an amount of days to rent. These become instance variables as we work with them in the class methods. For the price method, we simply assign a daily price for each type of board: lb, sb, or fb. Our price is calculated using simple mathematical methods that multiply the daily price according to the type of board and the number of days renting the board. As I mentioned earlier, we would also like to give a price discount to anyone who rents for more than 3 days. The last if/else statement in the price method reflects this 20% discount for all rentals over 3 days. We then ask the method to display the price.
    </p>
    <p>
     What is so cool about classes is that we can continue to expand the possibilities of the SurfboardRental class. We can include more surfboard types later, or change the pricing structure. Ruby classes are an incredibly powerful tool.
