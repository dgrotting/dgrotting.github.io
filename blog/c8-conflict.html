  <h1>Conflicts</h1>
  <h2>A reflection</h2>
  <h4>May 10th 2015</h4>

    <p>
      We have all been involved in conflicts before. It could be at home, it could be at work, it could be anywhere you interact with others. I am going to talk about a conflict I ran into at work a few months ago and address how I dealt with the conflict. We were sat down by our boss at work and told that we would be required to stay in the office until a certain time. This irked me because I am under the belief that if you are getting your work done, you should not feel required to create work for yourself jsut to stay at the office to a certain time. Some days should keep you at the office until late hours, and other days you should be able to leave earlier if you finish your work. I was very frustrated by this requirement and found myself leaving at the exact time that we were required to stay until. I found myself looking at the clock counting the hours down until we were able to leave. This hurt my work ethic and I did not feel as excited about work as I had in the past. I dealt with this conflict in a bad way because I did not express myself vocally about my thoughts. Instead, I allowed my frustration to build up. I assume if I had a conversation with my boss about my opinion, he would have been reasonable and understood my side. It is very important to be able to formulate your thoughts about a frustration and clearly share with others involved in the conflict how you feel. I need to not let frustrations build up internally, because they will never find a resolution that way. I want to be more vocal about my thoughts in a conflict, and also try to see the conflict from both sides.
