  <h1>The Internet</h1>
  <h2>How does it all work?</h2>

      The internet. Something we use almost every day. But what is it exactly? I am going to give you a high level overview on what exactly the internet is and how it works. Let's first think of a basic network. Two computers can be connected by a cable and effectively be on the same network. Now imagine the internet as just this but that all computers are connected by a cable. Computers can exchange information between one another by sending 'packets' of information along this internet cable. Now on this internet cable, there are computers called servers which store web page information. You can access servers via their IP address, which is accessible by their url. So, when you go to Google.com, you are actually accessing a server that contains the information that Google.com is supposed to display.

      Your computer is not actually directly connected to the internet, but rather to an Internet service provider which is also connected to the internet. Every device connected to the internet has a unique IP address. This allows computers to have an identity, and also address to access information from one another. So, the internet is essentially a wire that allows computers to talk to one another. Pretty simple, right?
